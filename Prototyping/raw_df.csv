Title: Information Densification of Social Constructs via Behavior Analysis of Social Media Users - A Study on TwitterAbstract: We live in a digital era where everyday activities are increasingly being replaced by online interactions. In addition, technology advances and data availability are changing the way we expand our knowledge about ourselves, society, and the environment. Can people be affected by their life experiences (e.g., cultural, social, economic). Do social online interactions embed such singularities? This increasing availability of data, specially social media data, has called the attention of researchers, and we have been witnessing a boom of studies relying on this rich source. However, most research is tuned to improve the outcomes of specific problems. Therefore, the reuse of techniques used in different areas is limited to data specialists. We propose a straightforward data-driven methodology to perform exploratory analysis of social media data based on user characterization. In addition, we present the results of the application of this methodology to three different domains: sports - characterizing football supporters, culture - characterizing languages, and health - characterizing organ-donation awareness.

Football club managers have a challenging and remarkably volatile job‚Äîthe practice of sacking and replacing managers is widespread in the modern game. However, it is still unclear what exactly motivates managerial dismissal in clubs. More than ever, high-quality statistics are available to clubs, suggesting that dismissal decisions tend to be well informed. Likewise, supporters on social media might also influence clubs‚Äô decisions. Here we propose machine learning models to characterize the determinants of managerial dismissals. Is social media pressure associated with managerial sacking? Yes! We fit multiple ElasticNet regularised logistic regression models using features based on the social pressure of fans on Twitter and football statistics, showing that our best model obtains a balanced prediction accuracy of 0.75.
Social media platforms attempting to curb abuse and misinformation have been accused of political bias. We deploy neutral social bots who start following different news sources on Twitter, and track them to probe distinct biases emerging from platform mechanisms versus user interactions. We find no strong or consistent evidence of political bias in the news feed. Despite this, the news and information to which U.S. Twitter users are exposed depend strongly on the political leaning of their early connections. The interactions of conservative accounts are skewed toward the right, whereas liberal accounts are exposed to moderate content shifting their experience toward the political center. Partisan accounts, especially conservative ones, tend to receive more followers and follow more automated accounts. Conservative accounts also find themselves in denser communities and are exposed to more low-credibility content.

I had the pleasure of mentoring Namia during her Master's Thesis. From the very start, her dedication and passion for her work were unmistakable.Namia‚Äôs thesis on medical image segmentation, which leveraged cutting-edge AI algorithms and state-of-the-art models, was a complex undertaking that required collaboration with clinicians. Despite the challenges, she approached it with exceptional enthusiasm and determination. Her ability to apply advanced machine learning techniques to real-world medical problems was truly impressive. She consistently exceeded expectations, bringing innovative and impactful solutions to the table.Beyond her technical prowess, Namia is a remarkable individual. Her thoughtful nature, willingness to help others, and genuine desire to make a positive impact are qualities that will undoubtedly drive her success. She‚Äôs a valuable asset to any team, always bringing positivity and a collaborative spirit to every project she undertakes.I am confident that Namia will excel in any role that requires a blend of technical acumen, creative thinking, and a commitment to making a difference.

Trends of mobile learning in Computing Education from 2006 to 2014: A systematic review of research publications
AbstractThe majority of the existing research regarding mobile learning in computing education has primarily focused on studying the effectiveness of, and in some cases reporting about, implemented mobile learning solutions. However, it is equally important to explore development and application perspectives on the integration of mobile learning into computing education and identify practical implications for learning and teaching practices. In this study, the authors performed a systematic review of scientific publications related to mobile learning in computing education. After identifying relevant publications, they analysed them from three main aspects: technology and development, design of mobile learning solutions and applications, and implications for learning. The authors' study reveals that mobile learning in computing education has the potential to increase several affective traits of learners. In addition, mobile learning in computing education has matured enough to be mainly concerned with the mainstreaming of the computing curriculum rather than basic research.
The Impact of Mobile Devices for Learning in Higher Education Institutions: Nigerian Universities Case Study
International Journal of Modern Education and Computer Science (IJMECS) , 8 (8). pp. 43-50. ¬∑ Aug 8, 2016
AbstractMobile devices such as smartphones and tablets are becoming increasing popular among students, setting out a new way to communicate, collaborate and learn. The use of portable devices has the capability to inspire new approaches to learning. It is therefore important to examine the students' viewpoints about the educational use of mobile technology in supporting the learning process. The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of mobile devices for learning purposes by exploring the kinds of interactions that students in Nigerian universities have with their portable gadgets. A sample of 240 higher education students participated in the study by completing the researchers' questionnaire. The results of the study indicate the students use their portable devices to exchange education-related messages and academic files with classmates, search the internet and library databases for academic materials, practice online quizzes or tests and hold discussions with classmates among others. The statistical analyses result show that there is no significant difference in the students' use of mobile devices based on gender.

It took me 6 years to land my first Data Science job.

I was not an overnight success story.

I started interviewing for Data Science jobs in 2013.

Over the next 6 years, I failed EVERY interview I did.

But I never gave up. 

I kept learning, applying and interviewing.

Finally, in 2019, I did it. 

I landed my first Data Science job.

Without a bootcamp.
Without a Master's degree.

The best part was? It was my dream job at Meta.

I was officially a Data Scientist at Meta.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

My journey is also my ""why"".

‚Üí Why I write on LinkedIn everyday about Data careers
‚Üí Why I coach clients to landing their dream jobs
‚Üí Why I built a SQL interview platform: 
www.InterviewMaster.ai

I struggled to land my dream job.

But I eventually got there with a lot of trial-and-error.

I want to share what I learned with you.

So you can land your dream Data job faster and easier.

So you can (ultimately) live the life of your dreams.

Dawn is an exceptional mentor whose guidance has been instrumental in shaping my career in data analytics. With her extensive background as a veteran data scientist across various industries, she brings a wealth of knowledge and a unique perspective that is invaluable for anyone navigating this field.

Despite my lack of official experience in analytics roles or having ever interviewed for such positions, Dawn‚Äôs mentorship was pivotal. She coached me through my take-home tests and the interview process, providing not only her expert insights but also much-needed reassurance. Her ability to impart tried-and-true strategies gave me a significant competitive edge, especially in today‚Äôs challenging job market.

Perhaps most importantly, Dawn has an incredible knack for bolstering confidence. At times when I doubted my own abilities, she was there to remind me of my strengths and to help keep my insecurities at bay. Her support has been a key factor in my development and success.

I wholeheartedly recommend Dawn to anyone aiming to advance their career in data science or analytics. Her mentoring can truly make a difference in reaching your professional goals.

I've been a sales assistant at a couple of stores over the years. I acquired a great amount of knowledge from a variety of experiences, which will help me improve myself and my future actions.

As I started to improve my badminton fundamentals, I wanted to pass this onto the younger generation and try to help them as much as possible to improve themselves. This is why I chose to give up my free-time to assist with the coaching. I acquired a variety of skills throughout this time. However, the key one was adaptability as I began to realise everyone learns in different ways. Therefore, I had to use my creativity to create different tasks/challenges unique to each person but still having the same outcome.
Here I helped out at my school after the regular school day, where I was given various tasks to assist them in making it a better environment. These consisted of assisting younger people with homework or physical labour such as giving a helping hand to the site team with tasks they needed completing. By giving my time to these tasks I managed to acquire a whole variety of skills as listed below. These are just some of the key skills I managed to obtain during my time volunteering as it was yet a challenging experience but a necessity to learn and improve myself to elevate my future.

The future of a nation rests on its youth. Recognizing this, friends and I at ASB created Mathsters, a CSR initiative supporting students at Happy-Feet, a Mumbai NGO. Our initial hurdle was finding an NGO open to student volunteers. Once connected, we faced another challenge: a diverse student body with different age groups and languages. My upbringing, split between Mumbai and a less-privileged community, proved invaluable. I used my Marathi and Hindi to explain complex math concepts, fostering a fun and engaging environment with presentations, quizzes, and even a math-themed ""Jeopardy"" game. Recognizing varying learning paces, we divided students into groups. The positive impact was evident. Students grasped essential math skills, gained confidence, and were exposed to English.  Moving forward, Mathsters is committed to continuing these sessions and expanding our reach.

As a lifeguard, I was responsible for ensuring the safety of individuals. This involved close attention to detail and monitoring swimmers to assess their competence in order to minimise risk. I also enforced safety regulations, such as maintaining a clean and safe environment. Another one of my responsibilities was first aid training, with regular check-ups to ensure my skills were always up to date.
I had the opportunity to work alongside the CEO of Aura Creative, where I assisted with numerous marketing projects. My responsibilities included website design and conducting market research, both of which played a key role in helping me deliver successful marketing campaigns. I also worked with a team to pitch ideas, incorporating feedback to refine and enhance our strategies. This professional experience helped develop my creativity, enhance my collaborative work skills, and develop my ability to respond constructively to feedback.
My interest in Politics and International Relations stemmed from an interest in how power operates, its limitations, and its implications. Particularly, I am interested in how politics can affect and divide both the public and private sphere. To me, politics is not only about government but about the global networks, people, and systems that connect them. By studying this, I hope to develop my analytical skills, challenge assumptions and continue to advocate for positive change.

As a Customer Assistant, I was responsible for many tasks ranging from operating tills to performing digital safety checks on different products. This role required meticulous organisation and thoroughly honed in my time-management skills and my attention to detail. This position also entailed frequent interaction with customers whether it be through serving a customer at the till or helping to resolve a query- allowing me to develop strong interpersonal skills and the ability to remain calm and level-headed in stressful situations.
My role as a night time Trading Assistant mainly comprised of stocking up different departments within the store in preparation for the day ahead. Despite operating during unsocial hours, this role required many core skills such as working under time pressure and thinking analytically for instance by finding the optimal way to arrange and break down large amounts of stock upon delivery at the store.
My role as a Student Assistant made me responsible for marking, recording and assisting students with their Mathematics and English worksheets. Through assisting students with topics ranging from basic arithmetic to integral calculus, I was able to greatly enhance my analytical skills as well as my ability to think creativity and explore different ways to explain a specific concept, if and when a student was not grasping the intuition behind a certain approach.
In this panel, led by President and CEO of Women's World Banking, Mary Ellen Iskenderian, myself along with a group of others proposed strategies to help reduce gender disparities in accessibility towards financial services. It was a truly eye-opening experience and significantly helped to better my understanding of gender inequality in the worldwide banking sector, and what we can do to ameliorate such a crucial constraint .

I taught remotely and through my mentorship, I helped students learn the fundamentals and be able to hold a conversation in English.

The Combined Cadet Force seeks to help teenagers take the next step in life and reach their potential. Training as a Royal Marine was physically and mentally enriching; it required tenacity and persistence, and I gained practical, transferrable aptitudes and core life skills. I learned discipline and diligence from my training as I had to be capable of leading a team and cooperating to overcome obstacles, allowing me to obtain valuable communication skills and ingenuity.
I ran a club for primary school students to teach them French. There were classes of up to 30 students, including children with learning differences. My responsibilities included teaching and designing engaging lesson plans that got all the children involved and inspired.

I work with prospective students and families educating them on university life and what the university of Exeter has to offer!
Lifeguarding has required me to maintain physical discipline in order to be able to perform my job and maintain readiness. I have also learnt to deal with quieter periods and learned ways to keep my mind alert at all times. Finally, during medical emergencies I have been able to maintain composure and communicate clearly to colleagues.

I have had the privilege of having Dave as a close friend and mentor since i was young but particularly over the past academic year. As a student who's just finished their first year studying Economics with Politics at the university of Exeter, the breadth of knowledge and exposure that Dave has been able to offer me has been immense and has expanded and sharpened my perspective on business environments and the opportunities that flood from hard graft.Four months ago, I shadowed Dave as he delivered a workshop on emotional intelligence and my eyes were opened to a brand new area of business that is never taught and yet is so critical to mastering business efficiency. I went away with a new perspective and was able to chat about the day afterwards with Dave, cementing this new outlook that would surely be a critical aspect of what i will hope to bring to future corporate interactions.Furthermore, Dave's range of clients has enabled me a wide breadth of exposure to various industries, and this is credit to his expertise in what he teaches. Although he may not be an expert on every industry he works in, he has perfected what he delivers and is confident that it makes significant differences in companies, something that has been clearly evident to me as i have shadowed.The thing that has stood out the most through our one-to-one chats has been Dave's pure passion for the job he does, and how he has grown it. He knows what he is good at, and knows the value it will add to companies and for that reason it is easy to see why MindGap has succeeded. However, this would not have happened without a passion that is willing to put in hours above and beyond the norm.I am grateful for the time he has given me, and love that he sees the importance of freely investing in young, innovative minds. I look forward to continuing to learn from him.

In the meantime, I am working for Rivoli Jewellers as a Sales Assistant. I am a very driven, academic individual ready to pursue a career as a solicitor.
I was awarded a place on Carey Olsen's bursary scheme which has allowed me to undertake some invaluable work experience within the law firm. I have shadowed partners, attended meetings, drafted documents and spent crucial time seeing life as a lawyer in practice. This work experience has taken place within the Corporate, Litigation and Trust and Private Wealth departments, and by the end of the scheme, I will have gained experience across a lot more departments within Carey Olsen to help widen my skill set and exposure to the working world of law.
I attended a first year open day at the Slaughter and May office, which was very beneficial to develop my insight into Commercial Law. I learnt about the company and their business operation, completed a case task, listened to a panel of current training contract employees and learnt about their progression into the company, had the opportunity to network with other law students and company members.
I worked as a Sales Assistant for a high end jewellery shop, serving customers which helped me to develop excellent communication skills, a wide range of knowledge for the products we sold and quick thinking to suit the customer's needs all contributing to my customer service skills.
I gained work experience within the Crown Prosecution Service within the Law Offices Department in Jersey. During this experience, I shadowed a training Advocate and attended the Criminal Court, read up on cases prior to their court hearing, prepared bundles and saw what it would be like to be a barrister.
I completed volunteering experience at Little Sisters of the Poor as part of my Duke of Edinburgh award. During this role, I served lunch to the elderly people, cleaned up in the kitchen, cleared tables and offered to be someone the elderly people could talk to.
I was awarded an award for my efforts and excellence after completing my Psychology A Level in which I achieved an A*.
I completed my bronze Duke of Edinburgh award consisting of the final expedition alongside voluntary work. It was a great experience teaching me the importance of teamwork and community impact.

MSc Management Student at the University of Exeter | BA Spanish and Portuguese with distinction in Spoken Portuguese |
I am a First-Class Anthropology graduate from the University of Sussex and a Master‚Äôs in Management Graduate with a Distinction from the University of Exeter, which was supported by the ¬£20,000 Broad Reach Scholarship. My academic journey has equipped me with strong analytical skills, cultural awareness, and a strategic mindset, blending insights from anthropology with practical business knowledge.

With extensive retail experience and study abroad in Beijing and Seoul, I‚Äôve developed expertise in customer behavior, cross-cultural communication, and adaptability. These experiences have strengthened my ability to analyse data, deliver personalised customer solutions, and thrive in fast-paced environments. I‚Äôm passionate about applying this diverse skill set to roles focused on customer-driven innovation and merchandising strategy.
As the project lead for a strategic student business project with Mercer, I guided my team in creating a trends report, developing actionable insights, and formulating a comprehensive marketing strategy tailored to the client‚Äôs needs. We collaborated closely with stakeholders to ensure our findings aligned with their strategic goals. 

Throughout the project, I managed timelines, facilitated client meetings and interviews, and supported the team through various challenges. This experience enhanced my skills in project management, client engagement, negotiation, influencing, and data-driven insights, delivering valuable recommendations to support Mercer‚Äôs objectives.
This role entails working in a high-pressure environment, managing, and prioritising tasks in multiple roles, requiring strong organisation skills and strict time management, where I also have additional responsibility for training new employees, reporting back on progress and attainment to senior management.

Additionally, my role as a non-food specialist requires compliance with company promotional activity standards, while maintaining a responsibility for creative flexibility in merchandising and marketing the middle aisle products to increase sales- strong skills in creativity and attention to detail. I also identify potential changes to streamline store processes, pitching to management and resulting in improved efficiencies. I am additionally specially trained in the Bakery, Freshness, and Limited Offer departments.

2nd Year BSc Accounting and Finance with Industrial Experience student at the University of Exeter | Searching for Placement Year Role
I completed my referee's course at age 14, and since then, I have officiated hundreds of teams and thousands of players across both youth and adult leagues. This experience has honed my ability to make quick, accurate decisions and effectively communicate those decisions to the players. I regularly work in small teams‚Äîconsisting of myself and two linesmen‚Äîwhere strong teamwork is essential to ensure the correct calls are made. Additionally, I often handle challenging situations, which sometimes require me to write post-match disciplinary reports.
I completed an 8-week internship at AB Dynamics as a Group Finance Intern, where I gained hands-on experience across various teams, including the PLC, Finance, and Stores departments. As my first significant role in the finance industry, this opportunity gave me invaluable insight into the workings of a ¬£100 million company and helped me develop essential skills such as data analysis, teamwork, and problem-solving. My responsibilities ranged from participating in the annual stock count to handling key financial tasks such as revenue recognition, cost-benefit analysis, purchase price variance analysis, and inventory valuation. I regularly utilised Excel and accounting software like IFS, which significantly enhanced my technical proficiency. However, the most valuable lesson I learned was the importance of soft skills, particularly communication and networking. These were crucial for effective teamwork and cross-departmental collaboration. I believe my soft skills saw the most growth over the course of the internship.
I completed a 42-hour week of work experience at Albert Goodman, where I worked on and managed accounts for various clients and performed tasks such as bank reconciliation and tax returns. A highlight of the week was the balance between working closely with a manager while still being given a high level of independence and responsibility. The most beneficial aspects of the week included gaining hands-on, practical experience in an office environment and learning to use industry-specific software like Virtual Cabinet, which offered insights not available at university. Additionally, I developed key soft skills such as communication and collaboration by working with different colleagues daily. This exposure allowed me to expand my professional network and learn from individuals in various roles and at different levels, all within a supportive and growth-oriented environment.
I completed one week of work experience, where I undertook a range of roles, including shadowing employees, handling administrative tasks, and working on accounts, which provided me with a well-rounded understanding of how a business operates. I utilised software such as QuickBooks and Excel to efficiently organise and manage accounts. The most beneficial aspect of the week was gaining insight into the dynamics of a business and office environment. This experience helped me recognize the key differences between an office and a school setting, particularly the increased importance of skills such as critical thinking and collaboration.

An educational event in promoting psychological informed conversations and practitioners resilience for young-adult hip surgeons
Working in young adult hip can present a number of challenges, particularly due to the level of chronicity that patients are faced with. The age at which patients tend to become involved with the service can mean significant life transitions, and comorbid mental health difficulties are likely to occur. Importantly, the presence of a mental health condition has been shown to negatively impact on their physical health outcomes. These conditions can often be undiagnosed, and presents a challenge for clinicians who may suspect additional support is needed in order to maximise benefits and positive outcomes from the service. The fluctuations and additional challenges of mental health difficulties with patients can also lead to additional pressures on the clinical team, as well staff wellbeing. This half-day educational event provided tools and strategies to support psychologically informed conversations with patients, and consider ways we can support our own resilience, and was aimed at those with direct clinical contact in young adult hip.

As I enter my final year, I am actively seeking employment opportunities within international and reputable companies.As a Turkish citizen who was raised and educated in an international school in Shanghai, China, I have developed a global perspective.

Additionally, I have a creative inclination that I nurture through music, continually developing my skills on various instruments, including guitar, piano, and trombone.
Former Business Development Intern at Fiba Capital Istanbul. Now completing my final year at the University of Exeter, actively looking for Jobs worldwide
During my tenure as a business development intern over the past year, I have adeptly conducted in-depth research and developed comprehensive spreadsheets detailing the financials of private equity firms. I have produced insightful summaries of emerging companies across various sectors, including technology, energy, and retail which sought our investment. Additionally, I have established a robust IPO database, cataloging the financial performance of every company that has gone public in Turkey from 2021 to the present. I also had the privilege of having very helpful and kind superiors and co-workers, I was able to learn a lot from each of them and everyone contributed to making me feel comfortable and welcome. Therefore, I thank everybody and hope to have the privilege of working with them again in the future.
During my six-week tenure in the Finance Department, I acquired extensive knowledge and practical experience in budget management, gaining valuable insights into the operations of various departments from the core of the organization. Microsoft Excel served as an essential tool throughout this process, enabling me to enhance my proficiency significantly. By the conclusion of my internship, I had not only refined my Excel skills but also had the opportunity to create and present my own budget reports, which received approval from my superiors and were subsequently utilized.Presenting to senior leadership initially challenged me to embrace risk, evolve as an effective communicator, and ultimately foster greater self-confidence following the validation of my reports.Following my experience in the Finance Department, I transitioned to the Tenant Relations Department for an additional two weeks, where I engaged directly with tenants and end consumers. This role provided me with a unique opportunity to assess and refine my communication skills in a real-world setting. A particularly memorable moment occurred when we hosted a distinguished guest from the Inditex Group, renowned for its brands such as Zara and Massimo Dutti. Although the guest was conversing in English, he opted to include me in the meeting for translation, given my proficiency in Spanish. While my contributions may not have been pivotal to the meeting‚Äôs outcomes, they undoubtedly enhanced the overall atmosphere.Beyond the technical skills I gained during this eight-week internship, a crucial lesson emerged regarding crisis management. I learned the importance of mutual respect for the demands and needs of all parties involved, which is essential for establishing equilibrium in challenging situations. This experience underscored that cooperation and teamwork are vital components for sustaining a successful business, particularly in times of crisis, such as during a pandemic.
In the summer of 2020, I volunteered at a state orphanage in Shenyang, where I aimed to provide support to young children during my time there. My volunteer activities primarily involved engaging with the children through basketball and reading English books on a regular basis. While I cannot assert that my 38 hours of volunteer work transformed the children into exceptional basketball players or fluent English speakers, I can confidently state that I fostered an interest in foreign cultures within them.
This was an on-the-field internship, where I mainly have worked in a huge warehouse. Although it was the first warehouse I have seen, I think it was one of the biggest and most modern warehouses in comparison to its benchmarks. During this internship, I have been able to see a successful chain of command and to learn how roles of hierarchies operate. This was, in my opinion, together with a very high level of robotic technology usage, a very important reason of a precise and efficient operation.
My initial volunteer experience was with Bright Connection, a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting toddlers with mental and physical disabilities who face challenges in their daily lives. I volunteered full-time for three days on Hainan Island, located off the coast of Vietnam. My responsibilities included assisting the children with their daily activities and providing entertainment through reading English books and engaging in various games.During my time there, I became acutely aware of the difficult living conditions these children endure. In an effort to enhance their environment, I collaborated with fellow volunteers to repaint the entire facility. While this task was both time-consuming and physically demanding, it was profoundly rewarding to know that I positively impacted the lives of those I served.

I co-founded and managed The Pop Up Shop, a preloved uniform initiative that was created after friends and I saw the surplus uniform we each had after leaving secondary school. Acknowledging the waste of disposing of this, while recognising the struggles faced by families to purchase new uniform we collected, cleaned, and redistributed the clothes for donations. Raising around ¬£500, the shops success has led to continued management by new 6th formers. During this experience we faced an array of challenges which tested my skillset as well as helping to build new abilities that enabled me to work under pressure against strict deadlines and budgets whilst balancing my studies and other roles.
As Head of House, the team and I led an initiative to collect donations for local food banks struggling during the cost of living crisis. In just a couple weeks hundreds of donations were collected that enabled us to make a significant and positive impact on the local area, strengthening our relationship with the community whilst helping make a difference to those struggling during this period.

I was thrilled to receive my Duke of Edinburgh Gold Award in May of 2023. This award required years of hard work, commitment and volunteering. The ceremony was held at Buckingham Palace Gardens. It was an opportunity for myself and my peers to celebrate our hard work. DofE is a challenging and achievement focused voluntary programme, involving the evidence of achievements across 5 areas. Progress to Gold required successful completion and award of the silver and bronze awards.
This experience required assisting disabled and sick people during a trip to Lourdes. The process required a first aid training course certificate, empathy, and patience. My responsibilities varied from aiding individuals with basic and personal needs. We aided the guests on daily pilgrimages, catering to activities of their choice, offering physical and mental wellbeing support.
This was a teaching volunteering scheme named 'Language Leaders Award'. I undertook this process in my last two years as a student at Downside school. Whilst simultaneously working towards my A levels, I spent my free periods planning and delivering Spanish lessons to children ages 11-13. This award was designed to give students the opportunity to gain teaching experience. As an aspiring language teacher, this certificate gave me the positive reinforcement that I could pursue a career in teaching.

The AI-powered product search app is a web and mobile-based platform that uses artificial intelligence to simplify the process of searching for specific products and services online. The app utilizes natural language processing, machine learning algorithms, and image recognition to understand the user's search query, filter out irrelevant results, and suggest the most relevant options based on the user's preferences, browsing history, location, price range and other factors. The app also includes a chatbot feature that interacts with users and provides recommendations, answers questions, and even negotiate prices with retailers or service providers. By focusing specifically on product and service searches, the app offers a more personalized, efficient, and user-friendly experience than general search engines.
Small businesses within local communities who are looking for a low-cost and sustainable way to exchange goods and services. The unique value proposition of the business is that it allows for bartering and trading without the need for money, promoting a circular economy and fostering a sense of community.In terms of areas where a digital marketplace for bartering and trading goods and services would be most successful, urban areas with high population density and diverse communities would be ideal. These areas would provide a large pool of potential users, as well as a diverse range of goods and services being exchanged. Additionally, areas with a strong sense of community and a focus on sustainability would also be a good fit for this type of business. Another area where this business model could be successful is in rural areas where jobs and resources are scarce, and people have to be more self-sufficient.The unique value proposition of this business would be the ability to exchange goods and services without the need for money. This would make it an attractive option for those who are looking to save money or who may not have access to traditional forms of currency. Additionally, the platform's focus on connecting individuals and small businesses within their local communities would foster a sense of community and sustainability, by reusing and recycling items, and making use of skills and resources that already exist within the local area.

Small businesses within local communities who are looking for a low-cost and sustainable way to exchange goods and services. The unique value proposition of the business is that it allows for bartering and trading without the need for money, promoting a circular economy and fostering a sense of community.

In terms of areas where a digital marketplace for bartering and trading goods and services would be most successful, urban areas with high population density and diverse communities would be ideal. These areas would provide a large pool of potential users, as well as a diverse range of goods and services being exchanged. Additionally, areas with a strong sense of community and a focus on sustainability would also be a good fit for this type of business. Another area where this business model could be successful is in rural areas where jobs and resources are scarce, and people have to be more self-sufficient.
The unique value proposition of this business would be the ability to exchange goods and services without the need for money. This would make it an attractive option for those who are looking to save money or who may not have access to traditional forms of currency. Additionally, the platform's focus on connecting individuals and small businesses within their local communities would foster a sense of community and sustainability, by reusing and recycling items, and making use of skills and resources that already exist within the local area.

I am seeking a year in industry for September 2025 to explore my career aspirations and develop my analytical, problem solving and presentation skills.  Responsible and mature in approach, I have the skills to be able to focus well and execute any task set. I have a real passion for anything automotive-related from the intricacy of classic cars to the power of fighter-jet engines. The sleek and modern outside of the f1 cars especially intrigue me as to the precision of the calculations taken for each little part. I would love the opportunity to gain an understanding of academic principles with real examples of engineering.
Activities and societies: hockey, netball, sailing, and cricket, all competitively. band performance, maths club,
In groups of 7, my university challenged us to create a standing platform in the middle of the Bristol channel that was able to store data and measuring equipment as well as create its own energy source to power the platform. This was a test to utilise every aspect of the modules we were learning that year and teach ourselves how these all came together in unique ways. This project really intrigued me as I was able to see how the academic calculations can be relayed into physical machines, and how the small changes to code can have such a huge impact on the subject its programming.
