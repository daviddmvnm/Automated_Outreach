    "## Why We Save and Load LinkedIn Session Cookies\n",
    "\n",
    "To interact with LinkedIn programmatically (such as sending connections or scraping profiles), we need to be logged into our account. Normally, this would require logging in every time the script runs, which is time-consuming and may trigger LinkedIn's bot protection systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we save our login session using cookies. When we're already logged in, LinkedIn stores a session cookie that keeps us authenticated. By saving this cookie after a successful login, we can reuse it in future sessions without needing to log in again.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach has several advantages:\n",
    "- Avoids logging in manually every time\n",
    "- Reduces the chance of being blocked or flagged as a bot\n",
    "- Makes the bot fully automatic and ready to run on a schedule\n",
    "- Allows us to access LinkedIn pages that require authentication, like the feed or \"People You May Know\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we use two functions:\n",
    "- `save_linkedin_session(driver)`: saves the current session cookies to a file\n",
    "- `load_linkedin_session()`: loads the saved cookies to restore the session\n",
    "\n",
    "If the cookies are missing or expired, the script falls back to using a fresh `li_at` cookie to log in and then saves the new session.\n",
    "\n",
    "This setup allows our LinkedIn bot to operate without needing manual login each time.\n"
